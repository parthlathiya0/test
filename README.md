    - For the center of the group

### Clean, Fast, Readable and Memory effecient Code

> - [x] Using DefaultDict to Accumulate Votes from all different bills
> - [x] Using Counter to count all senators with same voting patterns
> - [x] Using python comprehentions to make business logic clearer
> - [x] Using Iterator Protocols to save memory and increase execution time
