    - within each group, average the points to get to a new guess
    - for the center of the group
    - Repeat multiple times: assign data and average the points

### Clean, Fast, Readable and Memory effecient Code

> - [x] *Using DefaultDict to Accumulate Votes from all different bills
> - [x] *Using Counter to count all senators with same voting patterns
> - [x] *Using python comprehentions to make business logic clearer
> - [x] *Using Iterator Protocols to save memory and increase execution time
> - [x] *Improving Function definition and Tuple structures for comeback code readibility
